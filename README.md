SBT plugin that uploads scala code coverage to [coveralls][] and
integrates with [Travis CI](#travis-ci-integration) and [GitHub
Actions](#github-actions-integration). This plugin uses [scoverage][]
to generate the code coverage metrics.

Please take a look at the [samples project][] to see some [sample
output][].

## Installation

1) Add the following to your `project/build.sbt` file

```scala

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.8.2")

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-coveralls" % "1.3.1")
```

2) Setup coveralls configuration options (such as [Specifying Your
Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token))

3) Register on [coveralls][]

4) Follow the instructions for either [Travis
CI](#travis-ci-integration) or [Manual Usage](#manual-usage)

## Travis CI Integration

`sbt-coveralls` can be run by [Travis CI][travis-docs]
by following these instructions:

1) Add the following to your `travis.yml`

    ```yaml
    script: "sbt clean coverage test"
    after_success: "sbt coverageReport coveralls"
    ```

   If you have a multi-module project, perform `coverageAggregate`
   [as a separate command][multi-project-reports].

    ```yaml
    script:
      - sbt clean coverage test coverageReport &&
        sbt coverageAggregate
    after_success:
      - sbt coveralls
    ```

2) Job done! Commit these changes to `travis.yml` to kick off your
Travis build and you should see coverage reports appear on [coveralls][].

## GitHub Actions Integration

`sbt-coveralls` can be run by [GitHub Actions][] by following these instructions:

1) Add the following to your `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

    ```yaml
    - name: Git checkout (merge)
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Git checkout (PR)
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0
        # see: https://frontside.com/blog/2020-05-26-github-actions-pull_request/#how-does-pull_request-affect-actionscheckout
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

    - name: Run tests
      run: sbt clean coverage test

    - name: Upload coverage data to Coveralls
      run: sbt coverageReport coveralls
      env:
        COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        COVERALLS_FLAG_NAME: Scala ${{ matrix.scala }}
    ```

    Note the separate checkout step for pull requests.
    It is needed because of
    [the way pull_request affects actions checkout](https://frontside.com/blog/2020-05-26-github-actions-pull_request/#how-does-pull_request-affect-actionscheckout),
    so correct commit info could be sent to coveralls.io

    If you have a multi-module project, perform `coverageAggregate`
    [as a separate command][multi-project-reports].

    ```yaml
    - name: Upload coverage data to Coveralls
      run: sbt coverageAggregate coveralls
      env:
        COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        COVERALLS_FLAG_NAME: Scala ${{ matrix.scala }}
    ```

2) Job done! Commit these changes to kick off your GitHub Actions
build and you should see coverage reports appear on [coveralls][].

## Manual Usage

1)  Get the repo token for your repo from [coveralls][].

1) Let `sbt-coveralls` know what your coveralls repo token is. See
[Specifying Your Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token)

2) In the SBT console, run `coverage` then your tests finishing with
`coveralls`. After running the command, you should see output similar
to the following:

       Uploading to coveralls.io succeeded: Job #17.1
       https://coveralls.io/jobs/12207

## Specifying Your Repo Token

There are several ways to tell `sbt-coveralls` your repo token to
support different use cases:

### Write your repo token into a file

Add the following to your `build.sbt`. The path can be absolute and
point to somewhere outside the project or relative and point somewhere
inside the project (such as `src/main/resources/token.txt`).

Just remember: **Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is
in a public git repository!**

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsTokenFile := "/path/to/my/repo/token.txt"
```

### Put your repo token directly in your `build.sbt`

**Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is in a public
git repository!**

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsToken := Some("my-token")
```

### Add an environment variable

Add an environment variable `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`, for example:

    export COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=my-token

## Specifying Your Coveralls Endpoint

If you're using [coveralls][] as your endpoint, then you don't need to
set this option. If you're using a hosted (enterprise) instance of
coveralls, you will need to specify your endpoint in one of two ways.

### Put your endpoint directly in your `build.sbt`

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsEndpoint := Some("http://my-instance.com")
```

### Add an environment variable

Add an environment variable `COVERALLS_ENDPOINT`, for example:

    export COVERALLS_ENDPOINT=http://my-instance.com

## Overriding the current branch

By default `sbt-coveralls` uses the currently checked-out branch for
reporting. To override the branch name add the `CI_BRANCH` variable,
for example:

    export CI_BRANCH=my-branch-name

## Specifying Source File Encoding

`sbt-coveralls` finds the encoding in `scalacOptions` setting value.
If not defined it assumes source files are encoded using
platform-specific encoding.  To specify encoding, add the following to
your `build.sbt`

```scala
scalacOptions += Seq("-encoding", "UTF-8")
```

## Using Travis-Pro

It is important to set the correct `service` when using Travis-Pro.
The default is to use `travis-ci`.  To override this value, add the
following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._
import org.scoverage.coveralls.TravisPro

coverallsService := Some(TravisPro)
```
